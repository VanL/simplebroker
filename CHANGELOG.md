- Added Python 3.14 support
- Updated CI/CD testing matrix and package classifiers

## [2.5.0] - 2025-08-13
### Changed
- Added config keyword argument to functions that use config values
- Allows easier testing, passing configs from API users
- All existing code should work without change

## [2.4.0] - 2025-08-13
### Added

## [2.3.2] - 2025-08-11
### Changed
- Moved common functionality in Watchers to BaseWatcher
- Exposed PollingStrategy as an optional parameter to Watchers 
- Added __str__ and __repr__ to Queues for convenience

## [2.3.1] - 2025-08-11
### Added
- Default message handlers: `simple_print_handler`, `json_print_handler`, `logger_handler`
- Default error handler: `default_error_handler` with config-aware internal wrapper
- Example demonstrating all default handlers (`examples/simple_watcher_example.py`)

### Changed
- Error handlers now use function defaults instead of None checks
- Simplified error handling code paths and improved type signatures

## [2.3.0] - 2025-08-10
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Watcher API reorganization for improved consistency:
  - All Watcher classes now use queue-first parameter order: `(queue, handler, *, db=None, stop_event=None)`
  - `QueueWatcher(queue_name, handler, db=db_path)` instead of `QueueWatcher(db_path, queue_name, handler)`
  - `QueueMoveWatcher(source_queue, dest_queue, handler, db=db_path)` follows same pattern
  - Removed complex dual-convention detection logic (175+ lines eliminated)
  - Simplified BaseWatcher architecture with consistent Queue object delegation
- Updated all examples and tests to use new API
- Improved docstring examples throughout watcher.py

### Technical
- Maintains CLI backward compatibility

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-19
### Added
- **New Python API** for programmatic queue operations:
  - `Queue` class with context manager support for simplified message handling
  - `QueueWatcher` and `QueueMoveWatcher` for real-time monitoring

  - `SQLRunner` protocol in `simplebroker.ext` for alternative database implementations
  - `TimestampGenerator` exposed for consistent timestamp handling across extensions
  - Example implementations included in new `examples/` directory
- `move` command to transfer specific messages by ID between queues

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete internal refactoring (CLI remains unchanged):

- Added UNIQUE constraint on timestamp column for improved data integrity

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-11
### Added
- `watch` command with three distinct modes:
  - **Consume mode** (default): Process and remove messages
  - **Peek mode** (`--peek`): Monitor without consuming
  - **Move mode** (`--move`): Drain all messages to another queue

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-09
